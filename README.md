# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent in C 

A from scratch implementation of Linear Regression algorithm with 2 fitting parameters. The parameters are optimised using Gradient Descent algorithm. The implementation also utilises GNUplot to plot the data and cost over epochs.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo into your folder

    `git clone https://github.com/sanjeev309/linear_regression_using_GD`

- Experiment with values of EPOCH, LEARNING_RATE and default theta values in main.cpp
- Execute make command to compile into an executable

    `make compile`

- Run the executable

    `./linear_reg`

- Clean for a rebuild

    `make clean`

### Prerequisites

*nix OS, gcc compiler, basic C programming and curiosity.
