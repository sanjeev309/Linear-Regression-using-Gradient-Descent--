The Following program using gradient descent to perform Linear regression on the user supplied data.

The TODO list is as follows:
 
Working Gradient Descent:  
Input data from text file:
High order Polynomial for non-linear data:
Add Regularisation:
Add Command Line Capabilities:
A decent GUI:            //Not a priority,though preferred
